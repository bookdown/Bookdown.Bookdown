- Adhere to the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

- Include tests. We strive for 100% test coverage at all times.

- Describe any backwards-compatiblity breaking changes. The project is reaching stability, so BC breaks are very important to note.
